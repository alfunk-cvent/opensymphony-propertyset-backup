<h1>PropertySet Requirements</h1>
<p>PropertySet has different requirements depending on the </p>
<p>OSCore is distributed as a single <b>oscore.jar</b> file. This file is deployable 
  as an EJB module or can be used as a standalone library, such as in a web project's 
  <b>WEB-INF/lib</b> directory. More info on the actual deployment/installation 
  of OSCore can be found in <a href="installation.html">here</a>. Because OSCore 
  can be intalled in two seperate ways (deployed or just used as an external library), 
  there are different requirements:</p>
<h3>EJB Requirements</h3>
<p>If you are going to install OSCore as a deployable EJB module, there requirements 
  a much stricter. OpenSymphony has made an effort to support every app server 
  possible, but unfortunately we can't provide support for all vendors. Included 
  &quot;out of the box&quot; in OSCore is vendor deployment descriptors for the 
  following vendors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.orionserver.com">Orion Application Server</a> (version 
    1.3.8+)</li>
  <li><a href="http://otn.oracle.com/products/ias/content.html">Oracle9iAS</a>, 
    aka OC4J (version 1.0.2.2+)</li>
  <li><a href="http|//www.bea.com">WebLogic Server</a> (version 6.1)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</a> (version 2.4.4)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pramati.com">Pramati Application Server</a> (version 
    3.0)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jrun.com">JRun</a> (version 4.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application server isn't listed here, then you will need to create 
  your own vendor specific deployment descriptors and repackage OSCore, either 
  by hand or with any tools supplied by your app server vendor. Likewise, if you 
  requirement special changes to any vendor deployment descriptors already packaged 
  in OSCore, you'll need to open up the jar file and make any changes (such as 
  datasource or CMP mappings).</p>
<p>OSCore also requires that a datasource be configured inside the application 
  server. By default the datasource used is <i>jdbc/DefaultDS</i>. <b>In addition 
  to these requirements, the <i>Standalone Requirements</i> below also apply.</b></p>
<h3>Standalone Requirements</h3>
<p>If you are not utilizing the EJB components of OSCore, the requirements for 
  using OSCore are very limited. Most libraries are optional, depending on which 
  provider you use for different utility classes. You may require the following 
  libraries (included in the OSCore distribution, but not related to OpenSymphony 
  in any way):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">log4j.jar</a>, 
    required if you use the Log4Provider</li>
  <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html">xalan.jar</a>, required 
    if you use the XalanXMLPrinterProvider or the XalanXPathProvider</li>
  <li>ognl.jar, required if you use the OGNLBeanProvider</li>
  <li>jdbc.jar, required if you use the JDBCPropertySet</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ofbiz.org">ofbcore-entity.jar and ofbizcore-share.jar</a>, 
    if you use the OFBizPropertySet</li>
</ul>
